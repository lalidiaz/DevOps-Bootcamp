# DevOps Challenge
This project consists of a basic application that uses Node.js, Nginx, and MySQL. Each time the page is refreshed, a new record is added to the database and displayed in a list on the same page.

The project has some flaws and errors that you need to identify and fix. We want you to apply your knowledge to solve these issues and improve the application's configuration.

## Tasks to Complete:
Error Correction and Improvement of Service Communication: Ensure that all applications (Node.js, Nginx, MySQL) start correctly and communicate effectively with each other. Resolve any issues that hinder the smooth operation of the application.

Documentation in the README: Create a detailed README file that explains the issues identified in the project and how you resolved them. Include steps to reproduce the problems, the solutions implemented, and any other relevant information.

### Instructions:
Analysis and Correction: Conduct an analysis of the project to identify errors and configuration issues. Implement the necessary corrections to ensure the application functions correctly.

Document Your Process: As you work on the project, make regular commits that show your thought process. This will help us understand how you approached the problems and the solutions you implemented.

### Repository:
You can clone the project repository using the following command:

```
git clone -b devops-docker-warning https://github.com/roxsross/devops-static-web.git
```

### Final Notes:
Don’t Worry if You Don’t Understand Everything: This challenge is designed to test your skills and help you learn. If you encounter concepts or parts of the problem that you don't fully understand, don't worry! Tackle the challenge as far as you can and document your questions in the README.

Commit Regularly: Make sure to commit frequently so we can follow your thought process and see how you solved the issues.

This challenge will allow you to practice key DevOps skills, including debugging errors, configuring services in containers, and documenting processes. Good luck!
