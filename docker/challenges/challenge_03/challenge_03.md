#Â Dockerize & Deploy: Full Stack Challenge with Java, Go, and PostgreSQL

The goal is to automate the build, testing, packaging, and deployment of the Java and Go applications, along with the PostgreSQL database, using Docker and Docker Compose. This involves incorporating semantic versioning practices and ensuring smooth continuous integration to guarantee continuous delivery and system stability.

Containerize a REST API in Java, a web application in Go, and a PostgreSQL database, then use Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers. Additionally, this includes pushing the images to Docker Hub and a bash script to handle versioning published on Docker Hub.
