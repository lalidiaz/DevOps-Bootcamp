## How to Deploy a Weather Application in React with PM2
I will learn to deploy a React application using PM2 to manage the process. This approach will allow me to keep my application running and make it easier to manage.

### 1.Update System
```
sudo apt update
```

### 2.Install Node.js y npm with NVM
Node Version Manager (NVM) makes it easy to manage multiple versions of Node.js. Follow these steps to install NVM and set up Node.js:

#### Instalar NVM:
Download and install NVM with the following command:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Verify the Installation and List Available Versions:
Make sure that NVM is installed correctly and check the available versions of Node.js:
```
nvm help
nvm list-remote
```

#### Install the Required Version of Node.js:
Install the specific version of Node.js that I need:

```
nvm install v20.16.0
```

#### Select the Version of Node.js to Use:
Select the version of Node.js that I just installed:
```
nvm use v20.16.0
```

#### Verify the Installed Version:
Check that Node.js and npm are available:
```
nvm current
```

### Clone Your Project
With Node.js and npm ready, itâ€™s time to clone and set up my project.

#### weather-app Application (Port 3000):
```
git clone -b devops-weather-app https://github.com/roxsross/devops-static-web.git
cd devops-static-web
npm install
```

You can repeat this process to deploy more applications as needed


### Configure PM2
PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications that makes it easy to keep applications running in the background and automatically restart them in case of failure.

#### Install PM2:
```
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

#### Verify PM2 Installation:
Make sure that PM2 is installed correctly:
```
pm2 list
```

#### Start the Application on Port 3000:
Start the weather-app and make sure it restarts automatically if it stops:

PM2 will ensure that your application continues running even if you close the terminal session, and the --watch flag will allow PM2 to monitor the files for changes.

### ðŸŽ‰âœ… Access the Application
Once I have configured PM2, I can access my application in the web browser.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to see my application in action.
