# Redirection and Pipes Exercises

### Exercise 1: Output and Input Redirection

#### 1.1 Redirect the output of the ls command to the file content.txt.

```
ls > content.txt
```

#### 1.2 Append a list of running processes to the end of content.txt.

```
ps >> content.txt
```

#### 1.3 Use content.txt as input for the sort command and save the result in ordered.txt.

```
sort < content.txt > ordered.txt
```

### Exercise 2: Error Redirection

#### 2.1 Redirect the errors from the ls command to a file called errors.txt.

```
ls file 2> errors.txt
```

#### 2.2 Append the errors generated by the ls command to the end of errors.txt.

```
ls other_file 2>> errors.txt

```

### Exercise 3: Using Pipes

#### 3.1 Use a pipe to count the number of lines in the file ordered.txt.

```
cat ordered.txt | wc -l
```

#### 3.2 Find all lines that contain the word "root" in the /etc/passwd file and redirect the output to root_users.txt.

```
grep "root" /etc/passwd > root_users.txt
```

#### 3.3 Combine grep, sort, and uniq to find and count the unique lines in root_users.txt.

```
cat root_users.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### Exercise 4: Combining Redirection and Pipes

#### 4.1 Find all files in the /var/log directory that contain the word "error" and save the result in log_errores.txt.

```
grep "error" /var/log/* > log_errores.txt
```

#### 4.2 Count the number of lines in log_errores.txt that contain the word "failed" and save the result in error_count.txt.

```
grep "failed" log_errores.txt | wc -l > error_count.txt

```

#### 4.3 Find and save in users_ssh.txt all users who have logged in via SSH, listed in /var/log/auth.log.

```
grep "sshd" /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted" > users_ssh.txt
```
